Crimson Text is an open source font family in the tradition of beautiful
oldstyle typefaces, inspired particularly by the fantastic work of people like
Jan Tschichold (Sabon), Robert Slimbach (Arno, Minion) and Jonathan Hoefler
(Hoefler Text). It features</p>
<ol>
<li>six cuts (Regular, Semibold and Bold with a Roman and Italic each)</li>
<li>characters for a wide range of European languages&mdash;though some are
    still better supported than others between different cuts</li>
<li>spacing/kerning done by Igino Marini's spectacular
   <a href="http://www.ikern.com/">iKern</a></li>
<li>an unbeatable price of&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;zero dollars! (Crimson is published under the Open Font License.)</li>
</ol>

<p>The latest version, including a simple webfont kit, are now available on
<a href="https://github.com/skosch/Crimson/">GitHub</a>.

<h3 class="nocounter">History</h3>

<p>I'd always felt that the world of free software was lacking good text type, so
in April 2010 I began drawing letters, lacking any type design experience. I
couldn't have picked a better time, since Google's webfont service was starting
up and looking for high-quality libre fonts. The early inclusion of my
then-crappy-looking product was sufficient moral (and financial) support to keep
things going.</p>
<p>A while later I was encouraged to rename the project from <em>Crimson Text</em> to
<em>Crimson</em> for brevity. The original intent had been to add a <em>Crimson Titling</em>
optical weight later on, but I had already been dropping the <em>Text</em> suffix in
conversations&mdash;out of sheer convenience, mind you&mdash;so I had no
objections. Soon enough however, two versions of the font were floating around
the web: the old, ugly <em>Crimson Text</em> and a vastly improved edition called
<em>Crimson</em>. To this day, this continues to confuse people, and I have lost all control over
the name. The filenames retain the <em>Text</em>, most conversations don't. This chaos was
as avoidable as it was predictable, and I take all responsibility for it.</p>
<p>In its first days, the font looked a lot like a Hoefler Text inbred with a
Baskerville. Over the months, it morphed into something much more like Minion.
That didn't happen because I aimed to produce a Minion clone; it's just where I
ended up after many iterations. <h3 class="nocounter">A note on Google's version</h3>

<p>Please be aware that the good folks over on Google's webfonts team are
still offering a very much outdated version of the font, with both
clumsy outlines and clumsy spacing, despite my regular reminder emails.
Until they fix it, I recommend you self-host the latest version of
the font by running the files through Fontsquirrel's <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator">Webfont
Generator</a> with
your preferred settings and putting the resulting ffiles on your own
server.</p>
<h3 class="nocounter">Current development</h3>

<p>Apart from the obvious lack of support for many exotic and beautiful languages
and the diacritics their orthographies or romanizations call for, I am aware of
a few other shortcomings:</p>
<ul class="tight">
<li>there seems to be trouble with line heights in certain applications,
  particularly in certain Mac apps. I only run Linux at home, so troubleshooting is
  difficult for me, and I'm not entirely sure if the problems have been fixed.</li>
<li>one user has reported problems with the output of certain printers. I have no
  detailed information.</li>
<li>ligatures are in the font, but the outlines are old and clumsy. I have decided
  to use a lowercase <em>f</em> with shorter arm, similar to the one in Tschichold's
  Sabon. I like ligatures too, but anglophones tend to be ignorant of their
  inherent orthographic trickiness in languages like German or Turkish. I will
  eventually update the standard ligatures though.</li>
<li>numerals are still a source of problems: I'd like both tabular and
  proportional digits in both lining and traditional style. Eventually I'll get
  around to it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="nocounter">Contribute</h3>

<p>Nothing makes my day like an email showcasing your work with the font. If you
discover the font in use, online or in meatspace, please let me know. It gives me warm
fuzzy feelings and reminds me to fix bugs.</p>
<p>If you have a comment about the outlines' design or a technical problem,
please open an issue on Github.</p>
<p>Finally, if you'd like to make additions or improvements to the font, I can give
you write access to the Github repo. Contributions are <em>very</em> welcome, as I barely have time to work on
type design these days. The following character ranges are in particularly high
demand: polytonic Greek, Cyrillic, Vietnamese, IPA, Math symbols (esp.
OpenType-Math), symbols and ornaments, and more optical weights (ha!).</p>
<h3 class="nocounter">Who uses Crimson</h3>

<p>Here's a selection of users I know of (shoot me an email if you find more):</p>

<li><a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja 2</a> (which was used to generate this website, by
  the way)</li>

</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, again, most of the above use Google's old version.</p>
<h3 class="nocounter">Credits</h3>

<p>This project owes its success to:</p>
<ul class="tight">
<li>Google's generous funding;</li>
<li>Adrien T&eacute;tar, for tirelessly fixing bugs;</li>
<li>Rainer Schuhsler, for correcting the vertical metrics;</li>
<li>a handful of anonymous donors;</li>
<li>Hector Haralambous from Athens, who contributed most of the Coptic and 
Cyrillic glyphs and is an invaluable asset when it comes to the design 
of Greek letters;</li>
<li>Georg Duffner, Vienna, who helped with OpenType wizardry
  (check out his amazing <a href="http://www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond/">EB Garamond</a> project)</li>
<li>Khaled Hosny, guru, for fixing things I never knew were broken;</li>
<li>George Williams, author of <a href="http://fontforge.org/">FontForge</a>;</li>
<li>and all those that have approached me with their helpful advice over the
years&mdash;there are too many of you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you all.</p>
