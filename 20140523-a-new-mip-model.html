<p>This blog post is a written version of the talk I gave at CPAIOR last year,
which in turn was an animated, pop-sci version of the original paper published
with <a href="http://tidel.mie.utoronto.ca/beck.php">J.C.
Beck</a> (<a
href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-07046-9_5">Springer Link</a>, <a
href="http://tidel.mie.utoronto.ca/pubs/kosch_cpaior2014.pdf">PDF</a>).</p>
<p>To make things short, we were working on the following problem: imagine, for the
moment, that you wanted to construct some marvelously complex machine, like an
airplane, and that your airplane consisted of, say, a hundred parts (ha!). Suppose now
that you are on a tight schedule, and so you need all 100 parts ready at specific
points in time. It just so happens that 50 of these parts need to be processed
by one particular machine in your factory, and it becomes clear that this
machine will be the bottleneck of your production line. What to do?</p>
<p>Now, just so we're on the same page, this is a real problem. Many airplane parts, for
example, are made of lightweight composite materials. Composites are made of a
so-called <em>matrix</em> of glue-like stuff (e.g. resin) for bulk and a woven fabric (e.g. of
carbon fiber) to hold it together. For the matrix to harden, it must go into
a curing oven for a certain minimum amount of time. Here is a video of such a
machine:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Th-sOyQb0P4?start=34" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>When we were considering this problem, a French doctorand named Arnaud Malapert had just <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221712002846">published</a> (<a href="http://www.crt.umontreal.ca/~louism/MGR_batch.pdf">PDF</a>) the results of his dissertation on our airplane factory problem. His approach was successful and sophisticated&mdash;maybe too sophisticated, we thought. Could we come up with a simpler technique?</p>
<h2>Modelling the problem</h2>
<p>Since all of those 50 parts are needed to make the plane, it
doesn't matter if 49 parts are ready on time if it means that the
50<sup>th</sup> will be delayed by two weeks. From that perspective, the
completion date of our airplane really only depends on the very last
part to be ready for assembly. Since some of the 50 parts need to be painted or
tested after curing, that part isn't necessarily the last one to leave the
curing oven; but it is the one to leave the curing oven with the greatest delay.</p>
<p>The video above showed a single elephantine cylinder being rolled into the oven chamber on a pushcart.
Of course, many of the parts are small enough to go onto a cart together, so
the central question becomes: which parts can we put onto a cart together, and which
one of those carts gets to go first?</p>
<p>If you've done integer programming before, or any similar kind of
discrete-math algorithmicking, then this will strike you as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete">one of
those</a> mind-boggling combinatorial problems
where we have to search through all the zillions of possible solutions to find the best
one. And indeed, it's one of those. So we will use an appropriate piece of software
<a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/commerce/optimization/cplex-optimizer/">CPLEX</a>
to do the searching for us. But the search is performed cleverly. As we
construct a potential solution by assigning parts onto carts, we know that the
greatest delay will only get worse with every assigned part, never better. So
whenever we get to a point in building a solution where the greatest delay is
<em>already worse</em> than that of the best known <em>complete</em> solution (i.e., one with
all parts assigned), then we should stop and try something else. This way, we'll
never waste time looking through solutions that we know won't be better
than what we already have. This common-sense strategy is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound]">branching-and-bounding</a>
and a good theoretical introduction is found
<a href="http://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/fileadmin/opt/IntegerProgramming_WS1314/ip-chapter8.pdf">here</a>. But don't worry about the details, they're not important here.</p>
<h3>Nomenclature</h3>
<p>The searching software (called solver) needs a way to know about
the relationship between parts, carts, and delays, so that it can
distinguish promising solutions from inauspicious ones as it systematically searches
through them. Because of the particular technique (called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming">linear programming</a>) that the
solver uses to avoid testing infeasible solutions, for instance those with carts running over, we must
formulate these relationships as linear inequalities. As you will see, that is
easy.</p>
<p>Before we can start, let's agree on some terminology. Because it is customary in
the AI scheduling community, we will call every part a <em>job</em> and give it an
index <span class="math">j</span>. Likewise, we will refer to the carts as
<em>batches</em> and number them by the order in which they go in the oven; let's use
the index <span class="math">k</span>.</p>
<p>Every job <span class="math">j</span> has three known properties:
<ul class="tight">
<li>a processing time <span class="math">p_j</span>: the minimum time it takes for the part to cure, so our airplane is safe,</li>
<li>a size <span class="math">s_j</span>: the amount of room it takes up on a cart,</li>
<li>a due date <span class="math">d_j</span>: the point at which the part <em>should</em> leave the oven to get
painted; we'll use this to calculate the part's delay.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The following animated figure should give you a rough visual idea of what we're dealing
with.</p>

<button id="ex1next">Next</button>
<div id="ex1exp" class="figexpright">All the jobs.</div>
</div>

<p>Speaking of the delay: scheduling people like to use
the term <em>lateness</em>. And what we're trying to minimize,
specifically, is the <em>maximum lateness</em>, or <span
class="math">L _ \text{max}</span>. We could call it a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">Minimax</a> optimization, of sorts.</p>
<h3>A naive MIP model</h3>
<p>After thinking about this batching thing for a short while, it becomes obvious
that what matters to a batch (in terms of lateness) are two things: the job with
the longest processing time, and the job with the earliest due date. The former
determines for how long the batch will stay in the oven; the latter is an
unlucky candidate for having the maximum lateness. All the other jobs in the
batch&mdash;well, all they have to worry about is whether they fit onto the cart at
all.</p>
<p>The fundamental rule we can determine with this problem is that to minimize
<span class="math">L _ {max}</span>, we need to find a solution in which all the
batches are sorted by increasing due date. Sure, other optimal solutions might
exist, but they can all be reshuffled to have their batches in due date order.
We'll refer to this rule as the <strong>earliest-due date</strong> rule, or
<strong>EDD</strong>.</p>
<p>Our set of inequalities revolves around a matrix of binary variables <span
class="math">x _ {jk}</span>. An entry in that matrix is set to 1 if job <span
class="math">j</span> is assigned to batch <span class="math">k</span>, and 0 if
not. Once we've agreed on that, everything else falls into place:</p>
<table class="mathalign">
<tr><td class="mathalign-right">
<div class="tmath">\text{Min.}\quad</div></td><td>
<div class="tmath">L _ \text{max}</div></td></tr>

<tr><td class="mathalign-right">
<div class="tmath">\text{s.t.}\quad</div></td><td>
<div class="tmath">\sum _ {k \in B} x _ {jk}= 1\quad \forall j \in J</div></td></tr>

<tr><td class="mathalign-right">
<div class="tmath"></div></td><td>
<div class="tmath">\sum _ {j \in J} s_j x _ {jk} \le b\quad \forall k \in B</div></td></tr>

<tr><td class="mathalign-right">
<div class="tmath"></div></td><td>
<div class="tmath">P_k \ge p_j x _ {jk} \quad \forall k \in B</div></td></tr>

<tr><td class="mathalign-right">
<div class="tmath"></div></td><td>
<div class="tmath">C_k = C _ {k-1} + P_k \quad \forall k \in B</div></td></tr>

<tr><td class="mathalign-right">
<div class="tmath"></div></td><td>
<div class="tmath">D_k \ge D _ {k-1} \quad \forall k \in B</div></td></tr>
<tr><td class="mathalign-right">
<div class="tmath"></div></td><td>
<div class="tmath">D_k \le (d _ \text{max} - d_j)(1- x _ {jk}) + d_j\quad \forall k \in B</div></td></tr>

<tr><td class="mathalign-right">
<div class="tmath"></div></td><td>
<div class="tmath">L _ \text{max} \ge C_k - D_k \quad \forall k \in B</div></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The first line, as is convention, announces the expression we desire to
minimize. The first <em>constraint</em>, then, following the conventional "s.t." for
"subject to", declares that each job can only be assigned to one batch: for each
job <span class="math">j</span> in the set of jobs <span class="math">J</span>,
the sum over all <span class="math">x _ j</span>'s of different <span
class="math">k</span>'s must be exactly one.</p>
<p>Similarly, the second constraint ensures that the sum of job sizes in a
batch doesn't exceed the cart's size <span class="math">b</span>. The
third constraint establishes a value for <span class="math">P_k</span>,
the processing time of batch <span class="math">k</span>: it's at least
as long as the longest of all of the jobs assigned to it. The fourth
constraint postulates the obvious: a batch's completion time <span
class="math">C_k</span> equals the completion time of the previous batch
plus its own processing time. Then we formulate the EDD rule; simple stuff.
The next constraint looks complex, but only makes
sure that the aggregate due date of a batch, <span class="math">D_k</span>, is
at most that of it's earliest-due job (unless it's an empty batch, in which case
we'll substitute a pointlessly huge number <span class="math">d _ \text{max}</span>). Finally, we'll declare <span class="math">L _ \text{max}</span> to be the greatest of all the delays suffered by the
individual batches. </p>
<p>Phew. Not so bad, was it?</p>
<p>The above looks like a run-of-the-mill MIP (Mixed-Integer Programming) model.
The price for this elegant, declarative programming style is that the solver's
performance is absolutely unpredictable. And&mdash;surprise!&mdash;in this case
it was nothing short of pathetic. Arnaud's model was able to
really shine in comparison.</p>
<h2>Remodelling the problem</h2>
<p>As it so often happens in life, the serendipitous mistakes bear more
fruit than all honest attempts at systematic work. I had just spent
about half a year trying various heuristics, decompositions etc., with
one of them being more disappointing than the next, when suddenly, after
mistakenly hitting <em>compile</em> in the middle of writing a constraint, the
solver started spitting out (correct) results at blazing speeds. The model made
absolutely no sense, and sure enough, some of the results ended up being
incorrect. But it inspired a new way for me to think about the problem at hand.</p>
<p>Instead of just talking about assignments of jobs to batches, we think of
an initial schedule (which we know is terrible) and then imagine making
improvements to it by moving jobs, one by one, into other batches. Permitting
only re-assignments (moves) that improve the maximum lateness provides a mental
framework to reason about constraints&mdash;even though at the end of the day,
there is no initial schedule, and the moves are still just assignments.</p>
<p>For reasons of simplicity, our initial schedule will be the schedule in
which each job is assigned to one batch, namely the batch that matches
its index number (<span class="math">j = k</span>). Oh, I forgot to
mention: to do that, we'll sort the jobs by increasing due date. This way, all
batches are in order of their due dates (EDD) and they all contain a single job.
Let's call it the <em>single-EDD</em> schedule.</p>
<p>Here's an example to demonstrate what happens when you play with the due date.
The following figure shows a single-EDD schedule.</p>
<div id="ex5"></div>

<p>Now, going from this single-EDD schedule, we can reach any solution by moving
jobs from their own batches into other batches. Indeed, we can look at any final
schedule as a set of moves starting from the single-EDD schedule&mdash;a set of
steps in move-space, if you will, starting from the origin. And we can rebuild
our MIP model from that mental starting point.</p>
<p>Before we consider constraints on processing and completion times,
let's think about the EDD rule. Starting from a single-EDD schedule,
the one way to violate the EDD order of batches is to move a job into
a later-scheduled batch. So let's ban such moves. In terms of the
assignment variable <span class="math">x_jk</span>, we can't have
assignment of a job <span class="math">j</span> into a batch with an
index <span class="math">k</span> greater than <span class="math">j<span>:</p>
<div class="math">
  x _ {jk} = 0 \quad \forall j, k \,|\, j < k.
</div>

<p>The animation below shows what that means in practice.</p>
<div id="ex2"> </div>

<div>
<button id="ex2prev">Previous</button>
<button id="ex2next">Next</button>
<div id="ex2exp" class="figexpright"></div>
</div>

<p>The animation demonstrates an important point: yes, there are ways to
move jobs into later batches without violating EDD. For example: if two
jobs scheduled in sequence share the same due date, then we can move the
first one into the second batch. But of course, we could also move the
second one into the first batch. Similarly, when the jobs are very small
compared to the capacity <span class="math">b</span>, we could move a
whole sequence of jobs into a later batch, which would then assume the
due date of the first of those jobs. But again: we could just as well move all
of those jobs into the first of the batches into the sequence, complying with
our rule and yet achieving the same end result.</p>
<p>The subtext here, and this is worth pointing out, is that batches are set up
from the start. They can be empty (which gives them a processing time of zero,
and a due date of infinity), but they will stay in place. They are the board on
which we move the jobs like gamepieces.</p>
<h3>Host jobs and guest jobs</h3>
<p>But here's another constraint we have to introduce: when you put a job into a
batch that just became empty, you end up messing with the EDD order. In other
terms: a job can never be a guest in a batch that doesn't have its host anymore.
Here's an example:</p>
<div id="ex3">
<img src='posts/20140523-a-new-mip-model/guestarr.svg' style='width: auto; height: 7.04em; left: 5em;
bottom: 10em; z-index:10;' class="ex1a" id="ex3a1">
<img src='posts/20140523-a-new-mip-model/hostarr.svg' style='width: auto; height: 8.96em; left: 8em;
bottom: -6em; z-index:10;' class="ex1a" id="ex3a2">
<img src='posts/20140523-a-new-mip-model/hostlessarr.svg' style='width: auto; height: 12.56em; left:
21.5em; bottom: 6.6em; z-index:10;' class="ex1a" id="ex3a3"> 
</div>

<p><button id="ex3prev">Previous</button>
<button id="ex3next">Next</button>
<div id="ex3exp" class="figexpright">
</div></p>
<p>Expressing this as a linear constraint is straightforward:
<div class="math">
x_{kk} \ge x_{jk} \quad \forall j, k \,|\, j &gt; k
</div>
In other words: when a job is no longer in its batch (i.e. <span class="math">x
_ {kk} = 0</span>), then none of the later jobs at all can be assigned to that
batch <span class="math">k</span>.</p>
<p>There is a reason we named them host jobs and guest jobs: it is to reinforce the
notion that a job <em>owns</em> its batch, because it determines its due date: since we
have agreed to only move jobs into earlier-scheduled batches, a batch's due date
will never change. In fact, we can give up the constraint
<div class="math">
  D_k = \min_{j\;in\;k} d_j \quad \forall k
</div>
in favour of the much simpler
<div class="math">
  D_k = d_k \quad \forall k.
</div></p>
<h3>Calculating maximum lateness</h3>
<p>This simplification comes in very handy for our piece de
r&eacute;sistance: calculating <span class="math">L _ {max}</span>, because not
only do all batches have an inherent due date, they also all have an inherent
lateness, namely their lateness in the single-EDD schedule:
<div class="math">
  L_{k,single} = C_{k,single} - D_k \quad \forall k.
</div>
To get from the single-EDD lateness to the batch's final lateness, all we have
to do is find out how the individual moves we made change the batch's completion
time. As we'll see in a second, that is easy.</p>
<p>First, I quickly need to mention that both right-hand terms in the above
equation are constants that we know up front: the single-EDD completion time is
simply the sum of all the processing times leading up to batch <span
class="math">k</span>. And <span class="math">D_k</span> is simply <span
class="math">d_k</span>, as we've found out above.</p>
<p>Here's how we'll calculate a batch's lateness <span class="math">L_k</span>: the
table below the animation shows you a row for <span class="math">L _
{k,single}</span>. Below, we'll tally up wherever completion times are changed
for the better or the worse. The bottom line (literally) shows you the values
for <span class="math">L_k</span> as we try out various moves.</p>

</table>

<p>Let's write out what we just did: </p>
<div class="math">
L_k = L _ {k, single} - \sum _ {h \le k} x _ {hh} p_h + \sum _ {h \le k} P' _ h
\quad \forall k
</div>

<p>Phew! The first term is known. The second term represents all the
batches <span class="math">h</span> before <span class="math">k</span>
that are empty: we can subtract their jobs' processing times from our
lateness. On the other hand (and this is the second term), we have to
add the overhangs (i.e. extra delays) we introduced when we moved long
guest jobs into shorter host batches. The overhang <span class="math">P_k</span>
is defined as
<table class="mathalign">
<tr><td class="mathalign-right"><span class="math">P' _ k \ge</span></td><td><span class="math">x _ {jk}
p_j - p_k</span></td><td><span class="math">\quad \forall k</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="mathalign-right"><span class="math">P' _ k \ge</span></td><td><span class="math">0</span></td><td><span class="math">\quad \forall k</span></td></tr>
</table>
such that it's great.</p>
<h2>Old vs. new model</h2>
<p>Here are the two models, side by side, without the foralls. We've gotten rid of two sets of
variables: <span class="math">D_k</span> and <span class="math">C_k</span>. But
not only that: we've also strengthened our constraints.</p>
<div>
<div style="float:left;">
<table>
<tr><td class="mathalign-right">
<div class="tmath">\text{Min.}\quad</div></td><td>
<div class="tmath">L _ \text{max}</div></td></tr>

</div>

<div>

<table class="mathalign">

<div class="tmath">\text{Min.}\quad</div></td><td>
<div class="tmath">L _ \text{max}</div></td></tr>

<tr><td class="mathalign-right">

<tr><td class="mathalign-right">
<div class="tmath"></div></td><td>
<div class="tmath">x _ {jk} = 0</div></td></tr>

<tr><td class="mathalign-right">
<div class="tmath"></div></td><td>
<div class="tmath"> L _ {k, single} - \sum _ {h \le k} x _ {hh} p_h + \sum _ {h \le k} P' _ h
</div></td></tr>
</table>
</div>

</div>

<p>You'll notice that <span class="math">C_k</span> and <span
class="math">D_k</span> have completely disappeared from the new model. </p>
<h3>Benchmarking</h3>
<p>We were able to get rid of two sets of variables. We also strengthened the
constraints: in the old model, moving jobs into later-scheduled batches was
okay, although those solutions are equivalent to those in which jobs are only
moved into earlier batches. Because of these improvements, we expected our new
model to perform better&mdash;that is, we expected the solver to find the
optimal solution quicker.</p>
<p>So we tested the model against 120 test instances, and indeed: it was a
difference like night and day. While the naive model above struggled to solve
problems with 25 jobs within a reasonable amount of time, the new one plowed
through many 75-job instances in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>Not only that, the new model held its own against Arnaud's sophisticated
algorithm as well (Arnaud is a good sport and helped us run his code). Here are
the results:</p>
<figure>
<img src="posts/20140523-a-new-mip-model/scattercomp.svg" alt="Comparison of results">
<figcaption>Every dot represents one benchmark instance; those solved faster by
our improved MIP model are shown below the diagonal.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is a good chance that Arnaud's algorithm in combination with newer
versions of the solver he used (Choco 3 vs Choco 2) will beat our model. But at
the end of the day, it's still relatively sophisticated. MIP models, on the
other hand, are easily implemented by just anyone, and we were able to greatly
improve on the "obvious" formulation just by applying some strategic thinking.</p>
<p>For the casual reader, I do hope this was a somewhat satisfactory answer to the
question of "what <em>exactly</em> are you working on?", and I hope the visualizations
conveyed an intuition for the ideas behind the proofs that make up the bulk of
the actual paper.</p>
<p>For those with a background in writing scheduling models or other
integer programs, I want to point out something <em>even cooler</em> (in my
opinion, at least) than having designed the new best-performing model, and that
is the way we arrived at our new model: we did it by reasoning about moving
a job from one batch to another, and forecasting the effects it would
have on the solution. That kind of stateful, procedural thinking feels
<em>wrong</em> in the declarative world of integer programming. And yet,
because the moves are really just <em>assignments</em>, and assignments are
independent of each other, it works&mdash;and it may be a useful way of
thinking about similar problems, too.</p>
